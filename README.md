This GitHub Action (amd64) deploys files in `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` to a remote folder via rsync over ssh. 

Use this action in a CD workflow which leaves deployable code in `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`.

The base-image [drinternet/rsync](https://github.com/JoshPiper/rsync-docker/) of this action is very small and is based on Alpine 3.22.1 (no cache) which results in fast deployments.

Alpine version: [3.22.1](https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.19.8-3.20.7-3.21.4-3.22.1-released.html)
Rsync version: [3.4.1-r0](https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/NEWS#3.4.1)

---

## Inputs

- `switches`* - The first is for any initial/required rsync flags, eg: `-avzr --delete`

- `rsh` - Remote shell commands

- `legacy_allow_rsa_hostkeys` - Enables support for legacy RSA host keys on OpenSSH 8.8+. ("true" / "false")

- `path` - The source path. Defaults to GITHUB_WORKSPACE and is relative to it

- `remote_path`* - The deployment target path

- `remote_host`* - The remote host

- `remote_port` - The remote port. Defaults to 22

- `remote_user`* - The remote user

- `remote_key`* - The remote ssh private key

- `remote_key_pass` - The remote ssh private key passphrase (if any)

``* = Required``

## Required secret(s)

This action needs secret variables for the ssh private key of your key pair. The public key part should be added to the authorized_keys file on the server that receives the deployment. The secret variable should be set in the Github secrets section of your org/repo and then referenced as the  `remote_key` input.

> Always use secrets when dealing with sensitive inputs!

For simplicity, we are using `REMOTE_*` as the secret variables throughout the examples.

## Current Version: 7.1.0

## Example usage

Simple:

```yml
name: DEPLOY
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: rsync deployments
      uses: burnett01/rsync-deployments@7.1.0
      with:
        switches: -avzr --delete
        path: src/
        remote_path: /var/www/html/
        remote_host: example.com
        remote_user: debian
        remote_key: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

Advanced:

```yml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: rsync deployments
      uses: burnett01/rsync-deployments@7.1.0
      with:
        switches: -avzr --delete --exclude="" --include="" --filter=""
        path: src/
        remote_path: /var/www/html/
        remote_host: example.com
        remote_port: 5555
        remote_user: debian
        remote_key: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

For better **security**, I suggest you create additional secrets for remote_host, remote_port, remote_user and remote_path inputs.

```yml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: rsync deployments
      uses: burnett01/rsync-deployments@7.1.0
      with:
        switches: -avzr --delete
        path: src/
        remote_path: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PATH }}
        remote_host: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_HOST }}
        remote_port: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PORT }}
        remote_user: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_USER }}
        remote_key: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

If your private key is passphrase protected you should use:

```yml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: rsync deployments
      uses: burnett01/rsync-deployments@7.1.0
      with:
        switches: -avzr --delete
        path: src/
        remote_path: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PATH }}
        remote_host: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_HOST }}
        remote_port: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PORT }}
        remote_user: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_USER }}
        remote_key: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PRIVATE_KEY }}
        remote_key_pass: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PRIVATE_KEY_PASS }}
```

#### Legacy RSA Hostkeys support for OpenSSH Servers >= 8.8+

If your remote OpenSSH Server still uses RSA hostkeys, then you have to
manually enable legacy support for this by using ``legacy_allow_rsa_hostkeys: "true"``.

```yml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: rsync deployments
      uses: burnett01/rsync-deployments@7.1.0
      with:
        switches: -avzr --delete
        legacy_allow_rsa_hostkeys: "true"
        path: src/
        remote_path: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PATH }}
        remote_host: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_HOST }}
        remote_port: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PORT }}
        remote_user: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_USER }}
        remote_key: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

See [#49](https://github.com/Burnett01/rsync-deployments/issues/49) and [#24](https://github.com/Burnett01/rsync-deployments/issues/24) for more information.

**Note:** Only use this if necessary. It's recommended to upgrade your remote OpenSSH server instead.

## Troubleshooting

### SSH Permission Denied Errors

If you encounter "Permission denied (publickey,password)" errors, here are the most common solutions:

#### 1. SSH Key Setup

Ensure your SSH key pair is correctly generated and configured:

```bash
# Generate a new SSH key pair (recommended: Ed25519 or RSA 4096-bit)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "deploy@yourproject" -f ~/.ssh/deploy_yourproject -N ""
# OR for RSA:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "deploy@yourproject" -f ~/.ssh/deploy_yourproject -N ""
```

**Important Steps:**
- Add the **public key** (`.pub` file) to your server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- Add the **private key** (without `.pub` extension) to GitHub Secrets as `REMOTE_PRIVATE_KEY`
- Ensure correct file permissions on your server:
  ```bash
  chmod 700 ~/.ssh
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

For detailed information on creating and managing SSH keys, see [GitHub's SSH Key Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

#### 2. ``remote_path`` permissions

Make sure the ``remote_user`` has write access to ``remote_path``.

See: https://github.com/Burnett01/rsync-deployments/issues/81#issuecomment-3308152891

#### 3. Firewall / GitHub Actions IP Restrictions

If your remote server has firewall restrictions:

- **Option A:** Whitelist [GitHub Actions IP ranges](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#ip-addresses) (Azure-based)
- **Option B:** Use self-hosted runners on your server (recommended for strict firewall environments)

### Excluding files/folders (eg .git) 

By default, rsync copies dot files and folder if present at ``path:``. To exclude them, you can use the ``--exclude`` switch:

```yml
switches: -avzr --delete --exclude='.git/'
```

Other common exclusions:
```yml
switches: -avzr --delete --exclude='.git/' --exclude='node_modules/' --exclude='.env'
```
